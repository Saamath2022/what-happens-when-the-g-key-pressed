what-happens-when-the-g-key-pressed

When you type "google.com" into your browser and press Enter, the process involves several steps. Here’s a comprehensive breakdown of what happens from the moment you press the "g" key until the website loads:

1. Key Press Event
Interrupt Fires (Hardware Level)
Key Press Detection: When you press the "g" key, the keyboard switch for "g" closes, completing an electrical circuit.
Scan Code Generation: The keyboard generates a scan code for the "g" key.
Interrupt Request: An interrupt request (IRQ) is sent to the CPU to signal that a key has been pressed.
On Windows
WM_KEYDOWN Message: The operating system receives the scan code and translates it into a virtual-key code. A WM_KEYDOWN message is sent to the application with the keycode for "g".
Message Loop: The application’s message loop processes the WM_KEYDOWN message, and the app updates the text input field.
On macOS
NSEvent: The operating system translates the scan code into a keycode and creates a NSEvent object with the type KeyDown.
Event Handling: The NSEvent is dispatched to the application, updating the UI to show the character "g" in the text field.
On GNU/Linux
Xorg Server: The Xorg server listens for keycodes. When it detects the keycode for "g", it maps it to a keysym (keyboard symbol) using a keymap.
X Event: An X event is generated and sent to the appropriate application, which processes the key press event and displays "g".
This process repeats for each subsequent key press ("o", "o", "g", "l", "e", ".", "c", "o", "m").

2. The "Enter" Key Bottoms Out
When you press the "Enter" key, the following happens:

Same Hardware Level Steps: Similar to the "g" key press, an interrupt is generated, and the scan code for "Enter" is sent.
OS-specific Handling: The operating system processes the scan code, creating a WM_KEYDOWN message (Windows), NSEvent (macOS), or X event (Linux).
3. URL or Search Term Detection
Once the "Enter" key press is processed by the browser:

Input Evaluation: The browser evaluates the input to determine if it is a URL or a search term.
URL Detection:
Pattern Matching: The browser checks if the input matches a URL pattern (e.g., contains a domain name like "google.com").
Decision: Since "google.com" matches the URL pattern, it is identified as a URL.
4. DNS Request
DNS Lookup: The browser needs to find the IP address of "google.com".
DNS Cache: First, the browser checks its DNS cache to see if it already knows the IP address.
OS Cache: If not found, it queries the operating system’s DNS cache.
Router Cache: The request may then go to the router’s DNS cache.
ISP DNS: Finally, the request is sent to the ISP's DNS server, which resolves "google.com" to an IP address (e.g., 142.250.64.78).
5. TCP/IP Connection
TCP Handshake: The browser establishes a TCP connection with the server at the resolved IP address. This involves a three-step handshake:
SYN: The browser sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server.
SYN-ACK: The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet.
ACK: The browser sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet back to the server.
6. HTTPS/SSL
SSL/TLS Handshake: If the URL uses HTTPS, an SSL/TLS handshake is performed to establish a secure connection:
Certificate Exchange: The server sends its SSL certificate to the browser.
Key Exchange: The browser and server exchange keys to establish an encrypted communication channel.
7. HTTP Request
HTTP GET Request: The browser sends an HTTP GET request to the server, asking for the web page at "google.com".
8. Server Response
Load Balancer: The request may go through a load balancer that distributes it to one of many web servers to handle the load.
Web Server: The web server processes the request and fetches the necessary content.
Application Server: If needed, the web server may communicate with an application server to generate dynamic content.
Database: The application server may query a database to retrieve or store data.
9. Sending Data Back
HTTP Response: The web server sends an HTTP response back to the browser, containing the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other resources needed to render the page.
10. Rendering the Page
Parsing HTML: The browser parses the HTML and builds the Document Object Model (DOM).
Loading Resources: It then requests additional resources (images, CSS, JavaScript files) from the server.
Executing Scripts: JavaScript files are executed.
Rendering: The browser renders the page, displaying "google.com" to you.
This comprehensive process involves many layers of technology working together seamlessly to load a webpage when you type a URL and press Enter.
